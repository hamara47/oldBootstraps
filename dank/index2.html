      <p>Black metal is an extreme subgenre of metal as well as a subculture. Fast tempo and harsh vocals such as growling or shrieking which combined with lo-fi quality
	  recording sound much like a cold wind instead of the warm guttural sound that is featured in pretty much every other metal sub genre that doesn't have clean vocals.
	  Unconventional song structures, blast beat and distorted guitars with tremolo picking are ever present.
	  Often played by bands wearing all black, long usually black hair, black corpse paint make-up, spikes and studs, blood theatrics, pentagrams,
	  upside-down crosses, black leather and white face paint. Some forms of black metal put an emphasis on the nuances of ambient or atmospheric
	  aspects which include the suicidal or depressive subgenres of black metal, while others focus more on melody or technicality.
	  Black metal often crosses with folk or avantgarde and death metal does utilize it to some extent, in which case we are talking about blackened death metal.
	  The initial philosophy behind the genre as music according to the subculture was to be inaccessible to the mainstream and those who weren't committed.</p>
