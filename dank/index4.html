	  <p>Much like the rave and anger of punk or the hazy stoner summers of prog rock, the way of living of a subculture dies, but the tool box of sound remains. While black metal is mostly
	  a dead genre when it comes to the culture, the sound is still incorporated by artists whose roots lie in it. A fair share of post-metal and folk acts still utilize the techniques developed in
		the basements to convey atmosphere. Black metal bands still exist, to this day, but were they to exist back in the day the same way they are now, they'd never be seen as legitimate bands by the scene.
	  Other than just the sound of it, playing complex music has developed the skills of artists to a level where they can surprise the listener with different approaches even if the albums they
	  put out aren't metal at all. Good examples of such can be the French post-metal act Alcest which started as a black metal band, but as of now leans more towards a shoegazing sound or the
	  Icelandic prog/post-metal outfit which is the same and has slowly left behind the sound that it had upon birth. Both have been plagued with a Sigor RÃ³s soundscape in their latest albums and it
	  might be that they will completely ditch everything they utilized back in the day, yet between the days of yore and now, there are a couple of very solid albums that blend it to other elements.
	  While the subculture is questionable and incoherent, the hard work put on the music itself has paid off even for people who have no interest in anything the subculture stood for.</p>
