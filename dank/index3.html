	  The first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They were often speed metal or thrash metal bands.
	  The term "black metal" was coined by the English band Venom with their second album Black Metal (1982).
	  Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards, the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it.
	  Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted pseudonyms, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.
      Other bands deemed to have their hands in creating the first wave were such bands as Bathory, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate.
	  The 'second wave' of black metal began with Norwegian and Greek bands in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
	  with artists such as Burzum, Darkthrone, Mayhem, Rotting Christ and Varathron playing a major role in the development of the genre.
	  Black metal bands from the United States, such as Profanatica and VON, also formed around this time. Most modern black metal has built
	  upon the groundwork laid by bands during this time period.

		The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene.
		During 1990–1993, a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music.
		They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed
		by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum-Thorns and Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth of Mayhem. Fenriz of Darkthrone described
		it as being "derived from Bathory" and noted that "those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s".
		During May–June 1991, Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named Helvete in Oslo.
		It quickly became the focal point of Norway's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians;
		especially the members of Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns.
		In its basement, Euronymous founded an independent record label named Deathlike Silence Productions.
		With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels,
		who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.
		A fair share of events shaped the scene during the second wave.
		On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin known as Dead committed suicide while alone in a house shared by the band. Fellow musicians described Dead as odd,
		introverted and depressed. Before going onstage he went to great lengths to make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing.
		He'd bury his clothes to get the smell of grave to them, keep dead birds under his bed and sniff a dead crow in a plastic bag before going on stage.
		Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, said that Dead was the first to wear the distinctive corpse paint that became widespread in the scene.
		The body was found by Euronymous, who had to climb through an open window as the doors were locked and there were no other keys to the house.
		Before calling the police, he allegedly went to a shop and bought a disposable camera with which he photographed the body, after re-arranging some items.
		Euronymous used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's 'evil' image and claimed Dead had killed himself because death metal had become 'trendy' and commercialized.
		In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a stew with bits of Dead's brain and had made necklaces with bits of his skull.
		The band later denied the former rumor, but confirmed that the latter was true. Moreover, Euronymous claimed to have given these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy,
		which was confirmed by several other members of the scene.
		</p>
		<p>
		In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes, and between Euronymous and the Swedish black metal scene.
		On the night of 10 August 1993, Vikernes and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch drove from Bergen to Euronymous's apartment at Tøyengata in Oslo.
		Upon their arrival a confrontation began and Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found on the stairs outside the apartment with 23 stab wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and 16 to the back.
		Much of the satanism and admiration of evil just disappared with him and his store after he was murdered.
		Arsons on churches that had been widespread and in which Vikernes and Aarseth had both taken part in ended by 1996, but to that point at least 50 churches had been torched, a couple during Varg Vikernes' trial perhaps as a moral support.
		A fair share of the scene, Vikernes included were pagans and not satanists, but vehemently opposing christianity was all the same.

	  There is no defined third wave for black metal, but as it stands, but nowadays artists have their own interpretation of what actually was going on during early and mid 90s.
	  Some bands have moved towards viking metal sound with their paganistic ideas, some have incorporated progressive elements, some more folk, some ambient, some have moved
	  closer towards rock sound.
